== Introduction

* UniLA is a desktop utilities application designed for	NUS students who are typing oriented.
* UniLA provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing contact list and event list, contact interactions, planning meetings, setting up reminders, etc.
* The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `UniLA v1.4.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your UniLA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the UniLA.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Contact List Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::switch[]

=== Switching views: `switch`

Changes the view in the window. The default upon startup is in Contacts view. Running this command will toggle between contacts and events view.
Format: `switch`

Commands that require indices of one particular view as arguments may require you to switch to that view first. In those cases, switch to the appropriate view before running the command.

// end::switch[]

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the UniLA +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the UniLA. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the UniLA. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +

// tag::upgradefindcommand-yinya998[]
=== Locating persons by any field: `find`

Finds persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. +
User can search with or without prefix.
When search without prefix, any person whose fields contain any keywords will be returned.
When search with prefix, person who contains all keywords in his or her corresponding fields will be returned.

Format1: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* If there is no prefix, all fields will be searched.
****


These are 3 search pattern that user can search with `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches the input keyword with exact keywords found in the fields of contact list.

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches the input keyword to people's fields that have higher than 0.7 similarity. The similarity is calculated based on Levenshtein Distance. Further explanation is in developer guide.

3. Wildcard keyword match – Matches the input keyword with wildcard character *. * represents any number of characters.

*Search results are displayed in the following format:* +
n persons listed: +
 Exact Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Fuzzy Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Wildcard Search: +
 [NAME]… +

[TIP]
 There are three parts of executing 'find' command. First The input keywords are searched with exact string match. If it is not matched, then they are processed by fuzzy search. If fuzzy search still not matches, they will be searched by wildcard match.
 Any results displayed in the previous searching stage will not be shown in the next searching stage. +
 For example, if person Alice is found in exact string match, she will be displayed in exact search result and will not be displayed in fuzzy search result. This is to avoid message duplication.

Examples:

* `find victoria` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keyword `victoria` in exact search. For example, person whose name is Victoria or person who live in Victoria Street. +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `victoria`. For example, person whose tags contain keyword Victory. +

* `find Serangon firends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `Serangon` **or** `friends`  +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `Serangon` **or** `friends` +

* `find t/owemoney friends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose tags contain keywords `owemoney` **or** `friends` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose tags have keywords similar to to `owemoney` **or** `friends` +

* `find *@gmail.com` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `*@gmail.com` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `*@gmail.com` +
In wildcard search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that match regex `*@gmail.com` +

[NOTE]
Different search patterns optimize the 'find' command for different kind of user. They help with user who cannot remember the exact spelling or who are prone to typos.
