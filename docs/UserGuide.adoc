== Introduction

* UniLA is a desktop utilities application designed for	NUS students who are typing oriented.
* UniLA provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing contact list and event list, contact interactions, planning meetings, setting up reminders, etc.
* The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `UniLA v1.4.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your UniLA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the UniLA.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Contact List Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::switch[]

=== Switching views: `switch`

Changes the view in the window. The default upon startup is in Contacts view. Running this command will toggle between contacts and events view.

Format: `switch`

Commands that require indices of one particular view as arguments may require you to switch to that view first. In those cases, switch to the appropriate view before running the command.

// end::switch[]

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the UniLA +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the UniLA. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the UniLA. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

// tag::upgradefindcommand-yinya998[]
=== Locating persons by any field: `find`

Finds persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. +
User can search with or without prefix.
When search without prefix, any person whose fields contain any keywords will be returned.
When search with prefix, person who contains all keywords in his or her corresponding fields will be returned.

Format1: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* If there is no prefix, all fields will be searched.
****


These are 3 search pattern that user can search with `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches the input keyword with exact keywords found in the fields of contact list.

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches the input keyword to people's fields that have higher than 0.7 similarity. The similarity is calculated based on Levenshtein Distance. Further explanation is in developer guide.

3. Wildcard keyword match – Matches the input keyword with wildcard character *. * represents any number of characters.

*Search results are displayed in the following format:* +
n persons listed: +
 Exact Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Fuzzy Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Wildcard Search: +
 [NAME]… +

[TIP]
 There are three parts of executing 'find' command. First The input keywords are searched with exact string match. If it is not matched, then they are processed by fuzzy search. If fuzzy search still not matches, they will be searched by wildcard match.
 Any results displayed in the previous searching stage will not be shown in the next searching stage. +
 For example, if person Alice is found in exact string match, she will be displayed in exact search result and will not be displayed in fuzzy search result. This is to avoid message duplication.

Examples:

* `find victoria` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keyword `victoria` in exact search. For example, person whose name is Victoria or person who live in Victoria Street. +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `victoria`. For example, person whose tags contain keyword Victory. +

* `find Serangon firends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `Serangon` **or** `friends`  +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `Serangon` **or** `friends` +

* `find t/owemoney friends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose tags contain keywords `owemoney` **or** `friends` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose tags have keywords similar to to `owemoney` **or** `friends` +

* `find *@gmail.com` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `*@gmail.com` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords similar to `*@gmail.com` +
In wildcard search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that match regex `*@gmail.com` +

[NOTE]
Different search patterns optimize the 'find' command for different kind of user. They help with user who cannot remember the exact spelling or who are prone to typos.

// end::findEcommand-yinya998[]

// tag::meet[]

=== Planning a meeting : `meet`

This command allows users to automatically create a meeting event among certain people, removing the need to siphon through all the events just to find a common available timeslot among contacts to meet. The command will:

****
* search for the earliest available timeslot among the requested people to meet
* create the meeting event in the event list
* connect the requested people to the event and
* set the details of the event (such as name, description etc.) as requested.
****

==== Creating a simple meeting:

This section will explain how to create a simple meeting event lasting 2 hours, with the defaults of:

****
* Name: `New meeting`
* Description: `Meeting with contacts.`
* Venue: `NUS`
* Label: `meeting`
****

The earliest this event would be created will be at the start of the next hour from the time the event was run. That is, if user ran the command on 1st Jan 2019 at 4:59pm, the earliest meeting event that could be created would be on 1st Jan 2019 at 5pm.

Format: `meet INDEX` or `meet TAGS`, or both `meet INDEX TAGS` where

****
* `INDEX` denotes the indices of the people in the contact list the user wants to meet. For example, entering indices `1 2` will retrieve the 1st and 2nd persons in the contact list.
* `TAGS` denotes the tags of the people in the contact list the user wants to meet. For example, entering tags `t/friends` will retrieve all persons with the `friends` tag.
****

and these fields must adhere to the following requirements:

****
* `INDEX` *must be positive integers* 1, 2, 3...
* `TAGS` *must be valid alphanumeric tag names*, each with the `t/` prefix, such as `t/tagOne t/tagTwo`
****

*Note*: All fields are optional, but at least one valid person must be specified.

*Note*: Entering multiple tags create and/or relationships, more specifically, if a user specifies two tags, `tagone` and `tagtwo`, then every person who has `tagone` *and/or* `tagtwo` will be retrieved (think of it as a union of two sets, not the intersection).

Example 1:

* `list` +
List all contacts in index order. Find the indices of the contacts to meet. Say, the user requests to meet the 1st, 4th and 7th contact in this list. +
`meet 1 4 7` +
This creates a 2h meeting event including the 1st, 4th and 7th contact in the contacts list.

Example 2:

* `list` +
List all contacts in index order. Find the tags of the contacts to meet. Say, the user requests to meet contacts with the `friends` tag. +
`meet t/friends` +
This creates a 2h meeting event including all contacts with the `friends` tag.

Example 3:

* `list` +
List all contacts in index order. Find the indices and tags of the contacts to meet. Say, the user requests to meet the 1st and 3rd person, and everyone with the `family` and/or `colleagues` tags. +
`meet 1 3 t/family t/colleagues` +
This creates a 2h meeting event including the 1st, 3rd contact in the list, and all contacts with the `family` and/or `colleagues` tag.

==== Adding Event Details:

This section will explain how users can customize the name, description, venue and label of the meeting event, instead of sticking to the defaults.

Format: `meet INDEX TAGS n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION v/VENUE l/LABEL` where

****
* `NAME` is the name of the new meeting event
* `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the new meeting event
* `VENUE` is the venue of the new meeting event, and
* `LABEL` is the label given to this new meeting event.
****

and these fields must adhere to the following requirements:

****
* `NAME` must be a valid event name
* `DESCRIPTION` must be a valid event description
* `VENUE` must be a valid event venue and
* `LABEL` must be a valid alphanumeric event label.
****

*Note*: These fields are optional.

Example 1:

* `meet 1 n/Meetup with Alice` +
Creates a 2h meeting event with the first person in the contact list, and sets the event name to be `Meetup with Alice`.

Example 2:

* `meet 1 d/We're going out for breakfast, then heading to Starbucks for a discussion on our next project.` +
Creates a 2h meeting with the first person in the contact list, and sets the description of the meeting to the above description.

Example 3:

* `meet 1 v/COM1-B1111` +
Creates a 2h meeting with the first person in the contact list, and sets the venue of the meeting to `COM1-B1111`.

Example 4:

* `meet 1 l/meal` +
Creates a 2h meeting with the first person in the contact list, and sets the label of the meeting to be `meal`.

Example 5:

* `meet 2 t/friends n/Barbeque d/BBQ with old friends v/Sheares Hall l/relaxed` +
Creates a 2h meeting with the second person in the contact list and all contacts with the tag `friends`, and sets the event details to be the above.

==== Changing the Duration of the Event:

This section will explain how to change the duration of the event, instead of sticking to the default event duration of 2 hours. Note that the command will automatically search for the earliest available block of time of this same duration among all specified contacts, instead of only searching for 2-hour blocks.

Format: `meet INDEX TAGS duration/D H M S` where

****
* `D` is the number of days the event will have
* `H` is the number of hours the event will have
* `M` is the number of minutes the event will have, and
* `S` is the number of seconds the event will have.
****

and these fields must adhere to the following requirements:

****
* `D`, `H`, `M`, `S` are all integers, and
* The specified duration is nonnegative.
****

*Note*: This field is optional, and `D`, `H`, `M` and `S` *can* be negative. The command works as long as the duration in its *entirety* is nonnegative.

Example 1:

* `meet 1 duration/0 2 0 0` +
Creates a 2h meeting with the first person in the contact list.

Example 2:

* `meet 1 duration/1 2 3 40` +
Creates a 1-day, 2-hour, 3-minute and 40-second long meeting event with the first person in the contact list.

Example 3:

* `meet 1 duration/0 1 -1 0` +
Creates a 59-minute meeting event with the first person in the contact list (1 hour and -1 minutes equates to 59 minutes).

==== Setting Restrictions on Meeting Events

This section will explain how the user can specify restrictions on the possible meeting event. This is so that the user can prevent meeting events being created with odd start timings or extremely late end timings.

Format: `meet INDEX TAGS s/STARTDATETIME e/ENDDATETIME block/BLOCK` where

****
* `STARTDATETIME` is the earliest possible start date and time of the new meeting event
* `ENDDATETIME` is the latest possible end date and time of the new meeting event, and
* `BLOCK` denotes the block of *time* that the new meeting event *must* be in.
****

and must adhere to the following requirements:

****
* Both `STARTDATETIME` and `ENDDATETTIME` are valid DateTimes
* `BLOCK` is a valid block (see Defining a Valid Block).
****

*Note*: The earliest possible start date and time is the default, i.e. the next hour from the time the user enters the command.

Example 1:

* `meet 1 s/2019-05-26 12:00:00` +
creates a new 2-hour long meeting event with the first person of the contact list, with the earliest possible start time of the event to be 26 May 2019 at 12pm, unless the time of entering the command is after 26 May 2019 11am.

Example 2:

* `meet 1 e/2019-04-01 22:30:00` +
creates a new 2-hour long meeting event with the first person of the contact list, with the latest possible end time of the event to be 1st April 2019 at 10.30pm. If UniLA cannot find a suitable timeslot before this stated date and time, UniLA will prompt that no event can be made.

Example 3:

* `meet 1 block/!22:59 02:00` +
creates a new 2-hour long meeting with the first person of the contact list, and the event must not fall within 10.59pm to 2am of the next day. If UniLA cannot find a suitable timeslot that falls within this block (likely because the duration of the event exceeds the duration permitted by this block), then UniLA will prompt that no event can be made.

Example 4:

* `meet 1 s/2019-05-01 00:00:00 e/2019-05-07 00:00:00 block/school` +
creates a new 2-hour long meeting with the first person of the contact list, and the event must start at or after 1st May 2019 at 12am, must end at or before 7th May 2019 at 12am, and must fall within school hours, i.e. within 8am to 6pm of the same day.

===== Defining a Valid Block:
A block denotes the block of time that the new meeting event must be in.

It contains two timings, and possibly a `!` symbol, "negating" the block.

A block must be written as:
`block/<Optional ! symbol><Either two sets of timings in HH:MM separated by space, or a keyword>`

Examples:

* `block/00:00 13:32` +
indicates that the new meeting event *must* fall within 12am to 1.32pm within the same day (counting clockwise).
* `block/!22:00 04:00` +
indicates that the new meeting event *must not* fall within 10pm to 4am the next day, or effectively, the new meeting event must fall within 4am to 10pm within the same day.

Instead of entering two timings, users may opt to enter a keyword instead. The following is the full list of available keywords:

****
* `morning` denotes 6am to 12pm
* `afternoon` denotes 12pm to 6pm
* `evening` denotes 6pm to 8pm
* `night` denotes 8pm to 12am the next day
* `midnight` denotes 12am to 6am
* `school` denotes school hours, i.e. 8am to 6pm
* `breakfast` denotes 7am to 10am
* `lunch` denotes 12pm to 2pm
* `dinner` denotes 5pm to 8pm
* `supper` denotes 9pm to 1am the next day
* `brunch` denotes 10am to 1pm.
****

Examples:

* `block/breakfast` +
indicates that the new meeting event must fall within breakfast hours, defined to be 7am to 10am.
* `block/!night` +
indicates that the new meeting event must not fall within night time, defined to be 8pm to 12am the next day. Effectively, the event must fall within 12am to 8pm of the same day.
