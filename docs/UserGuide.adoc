== Introduction

* UniLA is a desktop utilities application designed for	NUS students who are typing oriented.
* UniLA provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing contact list and event list, contact interactions, planning meetings, setting up reminders, etc.
* The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +

// tag::upgradefindcommand-yinya998[]
=== Locating persons by any field: `find`

Finds persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. +
User can search with or without prefix.
When search without prefix, any person whose fields contain any keywords will be returned.
When search with prefix, person who contains all keywords in his or her corresponding fields will be returned.

Format1: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* If there is no prefix, all fields will be searched
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****


These are 3 search pattern that user can search with `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches the input keyword with exact keywords found in the fields of persons. +

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches the input keyword to fields of persons with a similarity comparison. Here Levenshtein distance is used to calculate the edit distance between two strings. Subsequently, similarity = 1 - Levenshtein_Distance/Max_Length_Of_Two_String. The similarity threshold is set to 0.7. If a person's fields containing keyword which have more than 0.7 similarity comparing to the input keywords, he or she will be returned as fuzzy search result. +

3. Wildcard keyword match – Matches your search keyword with wildcard character '*'. * represents any number of characters.

**Search results are displayed in the following format: +
n persons listed: +
 Exact Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Fuzzy Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Wildcard Search: +
 [NAME]… +

[TIP]
 There are three part of executing 'find' command. First The input keywords are searched with exact string match. If it is not matched, then they are processed by fuzzy search. If fuzzy search still not matches, they will be searched by wildcard match.
 Any results displayed in the previous searching stage will not be shown in the next searching stage. For example, if person Alice is found in exact string match, she will be displayed in exact search result list and will not be displayed in fuzzy search result. This is to avoid message duplication.

Examples:

* `find charlotte` +
search results:+
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keyword `John` in exact search
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that have 0.7 similarity to `John` in fuzzy search

* `find geylan firends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `geylan` **or** `friends`  +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that have 0.7 similarity to `geylan` **or** `friends` +

* `find t/friends teammate` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `friends` **or** `teammate` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that have 0.7 similarity to `friends` **or** `teammate` +

* `find *@gmail.com` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields contain keywords `*@gmail.com` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that have 0.7 similarity to `*@gmail.com` +
In wildcard search: Returns any person whose fields have keywords that matches regex `*@gmail.com` +


Different search patterns optimize the 'find' command for different kind of user. They helps with user who cannot remember the exact spelling or who are prone to typos.
