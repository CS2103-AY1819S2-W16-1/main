UniLA provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing contact list and event list, contact interactions, planning meetings, setting up reminders, etc. The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to automatically create a meeting event with persons*
** What it does: It allows users to create a meeting event among certain people, by automatically
*** search for the earliest available timeslot among the requested people to meet
*** create the meeting event in the event list
*** connect the requested people to the event and
*** set the details of the event (such as name, description etc.) as requested.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as the user's contact and event list grows, there may be too many people and events stored and it will be difficult for the user to find a suitable timing to meet the people he needs to. Thus the app must be able to conveniently help the user do so.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a switch command which allows the user to switch between person and events list view. All commands will also automatically switch accordingly or terminate depending on the current view of the window as the command was entered.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W16-1/main/tree/master/src/main] [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W16-1/main/tree/master/src/test] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
